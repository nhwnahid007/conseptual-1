      <h2>About Sunflower</h2>
      <p>
        <span class="imp">The sunflower</span> (Helianthus annuus) is a living annual plant in the family
        Asteraceae, with a large flower head (capitulum). The stem of the flower
        can grow up to 3 metres tall, with a flower head that can be 30 cm wide.
        Other types of sunflowers include the California Royal Sunflower, which
        has a burgundy (red + purple) flower head. The flower head is actually
        an inflorescence made of hundreds or thousands of tiny flowers called
        florets. The central florets look like the centre of a normal flower,
        apseudanthium. The benefit to the plant is that it is very easily seen
        by the insects and birds which pollinate it, and it produces thousands
        of seeds.
